# ACM HSG Autumn Coding Night
Welcome to the ACM HSG Autumn Coding Night! This is a repository for the event. You can find the data, slides and some sample code here.

=> Please do not use ChatGPT! In case you have questions do not hesitate to ask us.

## **Setup**
Before starting please make sure that you have the following installed:
- Python
- Pandas

## **Task**
The goal is to write a python script to detect fradulent transactions. The group that detects the most amount of correct transactions wins. The script should take the filepath to the input file as an argument and write the transaction ids of the detected frauds to a text file in the required structure. (See training dataset for reference)

**Additional Challenge:**
- Make sure that the script runs as fast as possible
- Try to lower the false-positive rate


## 📚 **Resources**
### 📊 **Training Data**
You can find the training data in the `training-data` folder. There is a data set describing the terminals and one that contains all customer data. Then there are two transaction folders. One containing all the inputs and another one with the outputs. For each day there is one input and one output file. The input file contains all the transactions that happened on that day. The output file contains all the transaction ids that were marked as frauds.

### 📝 **Slides**
You can find the slides in the `resources/slides` folder.

### 📚 **Links**
You can find some useful links in the `resources/links.md` file.
